    "## Hack Session : Allen Brain Cell Atlas - Data Access\n",
    "\n",
    "The Allen Brain Cell Atlas (ABC Atlas) aims to empower researchers worldwide to explore and analyze multiple whole-brain datasets simultaneously. As the Allen Institute and its collaborators continue to add new modalities, species, and insights to the ABC Atlas, this groundbreaking platform will keep growing, opening up endless possibilities for groundbreaking discoveries and breakthroughs in neuroscience. With the ABC Atlas, researchers everywhere can gain new insights into the brainâ€™s complex workings, advancing our understanding of this amazing organ in ways we never thought possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data associated with the ABC Atlas is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in an S3 bucket as a AWS Public Dataset, [arn:aws:s3:::allen-brain-cell-atlas](https://allen-brain-cell-atlas.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html). No account or login is required for access. The purpose of this repo is to provide an overview of the available data, how to download and use it through example use cases.\n",
