# Allen Brain Cell Atlas - Data Access

The Allen Brain Cell Atlas (ABC Atlas) aims to empower researchers worldwide to explore and analyze multiple whole-brain datasets simultaneously. As the Allen Institute and its collaborators continue to add new modalities, species, and insights to the ABC Atlas, this groundbreaking platform will keep growing, opening up endless possibilities for groundbreaking discoveries and breakthroughs in neuroscience. With the ABC Atlas, researchers everywhere can gain new insights into the brainâ€™s complex workings, advancing our understanding of this amazing organ in ways we never thought possible.

Data associated with the ABC Atlas is hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in an S3 bucket as a AWS Public Dataset, [arn:aws:s3:::allen-brain-cell-atlas](https://allen-brain-cell-atlas.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html). No account or login is required for access. The purpose of this repo is to provide an overview of the available data, how to download and use it through example use cases.

Each release has an associated **manifest.json** which list all the specific version of directories and files that are part of the release. We recommend using the manifest as the starting point of data download and usage.

Expression matrices are stored in the [anndata h5ad format](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and needs to be downloaded to a local file system for usage. To make data transfer, download and access more efficient, 
the 10x transcriptomics datasets have been subdivided into smaller packages grouped by method and anatomical origin. The notebooks provide example code on how to access data across these individual files.

Available notebooks:

* [**Getting started**](notebooks/getting_started.ipynb): learn how to use the manifest.json file to faciliate data download and usage.
