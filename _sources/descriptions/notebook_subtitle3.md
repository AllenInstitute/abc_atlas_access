# MERFISH whole brain spatial transcriptomics

* [**Part 1**](../notebooks/merfish_tutorial_part_1.ipynb): learn about the
  MERFISH dataset through some example use cases and visualization for a single
  brain section.
[*notebooks/merfish_tutorial_part_1.ipynb*]
* [**Part 2a**](../notebooks/merfish_tutorial_part_2a.ipynb): learn to access
  data and prepare for whole brain example use cases in part 2b.
 [*notebooks/merfish_tutorial_part_2a.ipynb*]
* [**Part 2b**](../notebooks/merfish_tutorial_part_2b.ipynb): explore the whole
  brain data through visualization and analyses of a set of genes of interest.
[*notebooks/merfish_tutorial_part_2b.ipynb*]
* [**Imputed Genes**](../notebooks/merfish_imputed_genes_example.ipynb): explore the whole
  brain, imputed gene data through visualization, analyses of a set of genes
  of interest, and comparison to the measured genes.
