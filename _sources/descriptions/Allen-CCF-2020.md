# Allen Mouse Common Coordinate Framework (2020 version)
Allen Mouse Brain Common Coordinate Framework (CCFv3, [Wang et al, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2020.04.007)) is a 3D reference space is an average brain at 10um voxel resolution created from serial two-photon tomography images of 1,675 young adult C57Bl6/J mice. Using multimodal reference data, the entire brain parcellated directly in 3D, labeling every voxel with a brain structure spanning 43 isocortical areas and their layers, 314 subcortical gray matter structures, 81 fiber tracts, and 8 ventricular structures. The 2020 version adds new annotations for layers of the Ammonâ€™s horn (CA), main olfactory bulb (MOB) and minor modification of surrounding fiber tracts. For the purpose of ABC atlas visualization and analysis, we have also created a simplifed 5 level anatomical heirarchy.
