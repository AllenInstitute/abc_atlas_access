# 10x scRNA-seq gene expression data

* [**Part 1**](../notebooks/10x_snRNASeq_tutorial_part_1.ipynb): learn about
  the 10x dataset through some example use cases and visualization of cells in
  the thalamus.
[*notebooks/10x_snRNASeq_tutorial_part_1.ipynb*]
* [**Part 2a**](../notebooks/10x_snRNASeq_tutorial_part_2a.ipynb): learn how to
  iterate through all the data packages, to access data for whole brain example
  use cases in part 2b.
