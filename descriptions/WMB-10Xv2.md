# Whole mouse brain 10Xv2 single cell transcriptomes

This dataset consists of 1.7 million single cell transcriptomes spanning the whole adult mouse brain using 10Xv2 chemistry. 
It was used in the creation of a high resolution transcriptomic and spatial atlas of cell types describe in [Yao et. al](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.06.531121v1).

The expression matrices and associated metadata is hosted on AWS S3 bucket as a AWS Public Dataset:

| Component | Current Version | Size |
