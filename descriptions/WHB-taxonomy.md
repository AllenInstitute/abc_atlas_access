# Human brain taxonomy of cell types

The data presented here from [Siletti et al. 2023](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add7046),
consists of nuclei collect from over three million single cells (approximately
two million neurons and one million non-neurons) from 100 locations across the
forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The integrated transcriptomic taxonomy
contains 31 superclusters, 461 clusters, and 3313 subclusters.

The associated metadata is hosted on AWS S3 bucket as a AWS Public Dataset:
