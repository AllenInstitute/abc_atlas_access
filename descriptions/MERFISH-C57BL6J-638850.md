# MERFISH spatial transcriptomics dataset of a single adult mouse brain

A 4.0 million cell spatial transcriptomics dataset spanning a single adult mouse brain with a 500 gene panel and mapped to the [whole mouse brain taxonomy](WMB-taxonomy). It was used in the creation of a high resolution transcriptomic and spatial atlas of cell types describe in [Yao et. al](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.06.531121v1).

The expression matrices and associated metadata is hosted on AWS S3 bucket as a AWS Public Dataset:
