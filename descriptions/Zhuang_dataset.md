# A molecularly defined and spatially resolved cell atlas of the whole mouse brain (Xiaowei Zhuang)

* 4.2 million cell spatial transcriptomics dataset spanning 147 coronal
  sections with a 1122 gene panel and mapped to the whole mouse brain taxonomy
  and Allen CCFv3 ([Zhuang-ABCA-1](Zhuang-ABCA-1.md); 2.8 million cells passed
  cell classification confidence score threshold and displayed in the ABC
  atlas)

  classification confidence score threshold and displayed in the ABC atlas)
