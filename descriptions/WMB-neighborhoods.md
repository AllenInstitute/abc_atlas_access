# Cluster groups and neighborhood specific UMAP embeddings

To further investigate the neuronal diversity within each major brain structure, [Yao et. al](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.06.531121v1) created concept of cell types "neighborhoods" or groups and use them for visualization and analysis. For each neighborhood, they genereated re-embedded UMAPS to reveal fine-grained relationships between neuronal types ([WMB-taxonomy](WMB-taxonomy.md)) within and between brain regions.

The associated metadata is hosted on AWS S3 bucket as a AWS Public Dataset:
